# Telerik DevOps upskill program, CI/CD tasks 
A repository created for practicing Github Actions.  
Feel free to fork this repository and work in the forked version.

Credits to Tom Reid for the Python Code.


To make me feel that I've learn something from this chapter my goal is to produce a GitHub action that:
[done] * Use linter to test the code;
[done] * Send a Slack notification on all action related to the repo
[done] * Deploy the code on nedko.info
* Build a very simple Python script on Linux, Windows and macOS;
* Use SonarCloud for code quality/code security
* Save artefacts in GitHub and/or jfrog artifactory
* Build docker container containing the python script
